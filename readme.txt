Dynamic Cart Quantity for WooCommerce

== Description ==

This plugin will hide the WooCommerce "Update Cart" button and reload the quantity changes dynamic over jQuery. You don't need this extra click anymore! 

This Plugin is based on a posting on StackExchange related to WordPress developers. I modified the basic concept and created a plugin out of it that WordPress users with less experience in PHP can integrate this function easily without destroying their functions.php file.

<strong>There are no options</strong>. Just activate the plugin and it will works.
